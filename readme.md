# OpenElections - NY

This is a repo of cleansing scripts and CSV outputs for [openelections/openelections-data-ny](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ny). 

So far working on converting PDF/XLSX files to proper CSV format, from various NY state counties reporting their results for the 2016 general election. Work has been done using a combination of Tabula, R, and Google sheets.

Official data is over at the [OpenElections repository](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ny) - this is just for me to keep track of my code and processes. 

The official website for this project is [OpenElections.net](http://www.openelections.net/). If you wanted to volunteer a contribution, more info is [here](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ny/issues/9).
