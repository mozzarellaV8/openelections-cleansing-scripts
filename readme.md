# OpenElections - NY

This is a repo of cleansing scripts and CSV outputs for [openelections/openelections-data-ny](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ny). 

So far working on converting PDF/XLSX files to proper CSV format, from various NY state counties reporting their results for the 2016 general election.

Official data is over at the [OpenElections repository](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ny) - this is just for me to keep track of my code and processes. The official website is [OpenElections](http://www.openelections.net/).
